/*
- Array name is starting address of array
- Array name can be used like a constant pointer (you are not allowed to change its value)
- Everything about pointers applies to array names, except that you cannot modify them
- You can use an array name like a pointer, e.g. *arr
- You can use a pointer like an array name, e.g. dPtr[0]
- Pointer arithmetic: Value of (intPtr+i) = intPtr + i * (size of an int)
- (intPtr+i) will point to the location i ints down from intPtr
- *(intPtr+i), *(arr+i), arr[i], intPtr[i] are equivalent, assuming intPtr holds arr
